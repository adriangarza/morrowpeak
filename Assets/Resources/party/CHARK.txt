!CHARK: Thanks, Alec.
CHARK: After 19 years of being alive...
CHARK: I'm still *hic* salty about my name.
CHARK: I mean, it could be worse. Have you met my sister Kiffany?
CHARK: So nah, I'm not bitter.
CHARK: And I'm definitely not *hic* drinking away my resentment.
CHARK: Haha.

PHOENIX: Aww, your name is fine! It's like Charles and Mark had a sexy little baby. ;)
CHARK: I guess.
CHARK: I wouldn't fuck that baby.

CHARK: Did you see that poor guy in the blue rat costume tho?
CHARK: He seems pretty unhappy. Maybe *hic* maybe even more than me.

CHARK: Phoe, come on. Take a shot with me.
PHOENIX: I dunno...weren't you supposed to drive Milo home?
CHARK: Oh. I keep forgetting about that. *Hic*
CHARK: I hid his keys...somewhere...shit.

CHARK: I'm sure I'll remember where...when I'm sober.
