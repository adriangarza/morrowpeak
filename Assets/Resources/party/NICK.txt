NICK: Did I tell you this story yet?
NICK: I stepped on a frog the other day. I was hiking with Allie in the dark and didn't see it.
NICK: ...
NICK: Feels bad, man.

NICK: It made this little noise, like a tiny "reee".
NICK: I still feel kinda guilty about it.
NICK: I mean, I know it wasn't really my fault.
ALLIE: Dude, it was totally your fault. You were busy talking to me. Or looking at my boobs.
NICK: Yeah, that's pretty likely. 
NICK: Still, though, it was dark. And it's not like I did it on purpose.

NICK: I hope he doesn't come back to haunt me.

ALLIE: R.I.P. lil frog.
