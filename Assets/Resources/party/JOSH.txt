!JOSH: Thanks, bro.
JOSH: Hey, Alex. How's life?
JOSH: Didn't talk much during the school year. Hope things were good.
JOSH: Oh, by the way, are these your keys? I found them in the bathtub.
JOSH: Hopefully Geg didn't lick them or anything. Haha.

JOSH: Man, remember his "aluminum phase"? It was sophomore year, I think. 
JOSH: And he fucking showed everyone those x-rays of his intestines. 
JOSH: God. Classic Geg.

JOSH: Anyway. Ugh.
JOSH: It was nice to see everyone at first, but hosting a party is stressful, man.

JOSH: I'm sure whoever lost those keys is still here.
JOSH: Can't get very far without 'em.
