!ALLIE: Oh, for me? Cool...I mean, thanks.
ALLIE: Nick, trust me, you'll be fine. 
ALLIE: Seriously, if I can smoke and still run cross-country, you can take a flaming shot.
NICK: I dunno, man....I'm very attached to my esophagus.
NICK: Oh, Alex is here.
ALLIE: Alex! It's good to see you, dude.

ALLIE: Oh, have you seen Louis yet?
ALLIE: I didn't think he'd actually fall for it!
NICK: Yeah, I almost feel bad for him.
NICK: The absolute madman.

ALLIE: Anyway. I don't know if you read my Tumblr, but
ALLIE: I've been having some deep thoughts lately.
ALLIE: Do you ever get the feeling like things are connected in weird, tiny ways?
ALLIE: Like, whenever you talk to someone, you change them a little bit.
ALLIE: People have the potential to change your entire life with just words.
ALLIE: And you might end up never talking to them again!

ALLIE: Life is weird, dude.
