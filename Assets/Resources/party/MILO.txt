!MILO: Thanks, I guess.
MILO:
MILO: ...What's up?
MILO:
MILO: You look different.
MILO: Not in a bad way. Just different?
MILO: I don't know. Maybe I do too. That's harder to tell.
MILO:
MILO: Sorry if I'm not making sense.
MILO: I've had quite a bit to drink already.

MILO: ...Phoebe?
MILO: Yeah, she's fine.
MILO:
MILO: We broke up, actually.
MILO: Yeah, a couple months into college.
MILO: Just wasn't right, I guess.
MILO:
MILO: We're good now, though.

MILO: Sorry. I meant to text you.
MILO: A few times a month, maybe.
MILO: But...at the same time, it's a two-way street, you know?
MILO: You know.

MILO: Hey...do you remember that time we hung out at the park 'til like...5 am?
MILO: It was during winter break. I don't remember the exact words.
MILO: But it kinda stuck with me. I don't know. I've thought about it a lot.
MILO: You just talked about...how much you hated it here. 
MILO: Like, I was a bit surprised. I guess I didn't really expect it.
MILO: You went on about...how dull the people are. Petty, self-absorbed.
MILO:
MILO: Do you still think that's true?
---
MILO: ...Alright. I hate to ask, but could you give me a ride home? 
MILO: I don't think anybody else at this party is sober.
MILO: Chark was my ride, but then Phoenix made him shotgun a beer. Or three...
MILO: 
MILO: No. That's cool. I understand. 
MILO: Can't blame you, I guess. 
MILO: 
MILO: Thing is, Chark knew I was gonna drink, so he put my car keys somewhere.
MILO: So if you find them, could you let me know?

MILO: Thanks, Alex.
